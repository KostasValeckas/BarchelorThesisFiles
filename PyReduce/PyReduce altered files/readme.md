These are the 'PyReduce' files that have been altered, and deviate from the standard 'PyReduce' pip installation, version 0.5.26.

These files have been helpfully provided by Patrick Dorval, UU (https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N22-2509)

These files were used to replaced the 'pip' distributed files, before any further alternations were done.
