## THE DIRECTORIES ARE NOT COMPLETE, AS THE 'PYPEIT' PRODUCTS ARE TOO LARGE IN SIZE FOR GITHUB

### To complete the directories, first download: https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/eEXyKHm3Af , then place the directories following the naming of the files. 

### The files downloaded are named in the following fashion: mode_target_productType (target: either 'SCIENCE' or 'STAR'), and hold a directory with the product type: either 'Masters' or 'Science'. To recreate original 'PypeIt' output "as it was", the directries should be placed in the following  fashion (upon already existing files): 


```bash
── mode 
│   ├── SCIENCE
│   │   ├── Masters
│   │   ├── Science
│   └── STAR
│       ├── Masters
│       ├── Science
```
