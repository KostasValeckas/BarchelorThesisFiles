### These are the resulting spectra from the reduction.

For NIR and VIS the results are provided both with and without telluric corrections.

For UVB, no telluric corrections were applied (as $\lambda > 7000$ Ã…) the for whole mode.

Both of the mentioned spectra are plottet with using the attached 'spectrumPlotter.py' script, that was originally kindly provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI), and altered only slightly.
