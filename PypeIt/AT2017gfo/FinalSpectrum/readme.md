### These are the resulting spectra from the reduction.

For NIR and VIS the results are provided both with and without telluric corrections.

For UVB, no telluric corrections were applied (as $\lambda > 7000$ Ã… the for whole mode).

Plots for both of the mentioned spectra are provided. These were obtained by using the attached 'spectrumPlotter.py' script, that was originally kindly provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI), and altered only slightly.
