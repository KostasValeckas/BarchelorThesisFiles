### These are the files that were used to produce the reduction of AT2017gfo X-shooter data with 'PypeIt' that is discussed in the thesis, with the output obtained.

### The different directories are grouped by the different "PypeIt" commands / reduction stages.

The directories are documented within, and always split up into different modes.

The 'FinalSpectrum' directory is for holding the final results and plots, including the Python script used for plotting (provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI))

The 'RefferencedPlots' directory is for larger scale view of some of the plots from the thesis.
