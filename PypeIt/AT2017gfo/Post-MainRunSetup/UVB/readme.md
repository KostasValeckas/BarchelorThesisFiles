### The setup files are created by calling: 

pypeit_flux_setup .

(where the '.' symbol points to this directory. If the files needed are placed elsewhere, it is to be exchanged with the path to the files)

To data needed are the 1d science spectra provided by the 'PypeIt' main run (both '.fits' and '.txt') files.

The 'vlt_xshooter_uvb.tell' is not used in the particular case of this thesis, and is only included for refference. 

The setup files are later altered following the comments within them.
