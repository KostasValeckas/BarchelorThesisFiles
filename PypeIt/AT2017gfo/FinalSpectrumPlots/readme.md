### This directory contains the data and python scrips needed to recreate the AT2017gfo spectra plots from the thesis, together with the plots themselves.

The building blocks for the plotting scripts were kindly provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI).

The directory 'Alone' is for plots only with the 'AT2017gfo' spectra.

The directory 'Compared' is for plots with the 'AT2017gfo' spectra compared to data from:


Pian et al. 2017, Nature, 551, 67
Smartt et al. 2017, Nature 551, 75
(this includes al lthe files in '.dat' format)
, where the compare_data_readme.txt is included for refference to the origin of the data. 

If the spectrum is telluricly corrected, it says so in the name.

The files holding the word 'glued' in the name are for spectra where the arms have been plottet on top of each other,
otherwise the arms are represented separately.
