### The telluric correction is excecuted by: 

pypeit_tellfit --objmodel poly AT2017gfoNIR.fits

The resulting files are  AT2017gfoNIR_tellcorr.fits (the corrected spectrum) and  AT2017gfoNIR_tellmodel.fits (the telluric model).

'telluric.par' is automatically created in excecution, and holds the default parameters used.
