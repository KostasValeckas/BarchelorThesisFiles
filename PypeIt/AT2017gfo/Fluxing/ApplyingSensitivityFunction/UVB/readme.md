### The sensitivity function is applied by calling: 

pypeit_flux_calib vlt_xshooter_uvb.flux

To see how the '.flux' file was created, please refer to the 'Post-MainRunSetup' directory.
To see how the 'sens' file holding the sensitivity function was created, please refer to 'SensitivityFunction' directory, that is placed in the same branch as this directory.

The included 'spec1d' files are altered by the alogirthm, so no new files are produced. This means that the included 'spec1d' files are both the input and the output.

The '.par' file is produced automatically in excecution, and shows the default parameters used.
