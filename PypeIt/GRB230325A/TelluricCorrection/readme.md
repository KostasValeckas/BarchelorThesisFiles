### The telluric correction is excecuted by: 

pypeit_tellfit --objmodel poly GRB230325A_NIR.fits

GRB230325A_NIR.fits is the flux calibrated, co-added spectrum

The resulting files are  'GRB230325A_NIR_tellcorr.fits' (the corrected spectrum) and 'GRB230325A_NIR_tellmodel.fits' (the telluric model).

'telluric.par' is automatically created in excecution, and holds the default parameters used.
