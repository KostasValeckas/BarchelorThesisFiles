### This directory contains the data and python scrips needed to recreate the GRB230325A spectra plots from the thesis, together with the plots themselves.

The python plotting scripts were kindly provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI), and altered only slightly.

If the spectrum is telluricly corrected, it says so in the name.
