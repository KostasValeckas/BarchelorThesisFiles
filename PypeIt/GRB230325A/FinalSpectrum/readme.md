This directory holds the final resulting spectrum obtained by using 'PypeIt' on X-shooter NIR GRB230325A data.

The data is provided and plottet both with and without the telluric corrections.

Plots referenced by the thesis are provided in better resolution.

The python plotting scripts used to make the plots are provided, originally kindly provided by Tom Reynolds (NBI), and altered only slightly.
